### Eagel ###
[Install Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download)
#### Schematic ####
The basic flow of Eagle is to start with a schematic, add all the parts and the connections, and then move to board to set up the final design to send to voltera. Add parts by clicking the add parts icon ![alt text](h![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Add Parts Icon.png")
